# Introduction

The data comes from an experiment performed in Cotney lab 3 years ago. I have retrieved the fastq files in the following directory : `/archive/labs/Cotney/DATA/STARR-Seq/ChIPSTARRseq_test/test_run_3/TYAN01*`.

# Description of the analysis steps

## Step 01 :

* Organization of fastq files : For this I used the script named : `script_organizing_fastq_files`

## Step 02 :

* Mapping the reads. For this I used the script named : `script_bowtie2_align_data`
